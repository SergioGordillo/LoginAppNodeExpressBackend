# Which is the purpose of this web app? :thinking:

It is a web app I made based on Fernando Herrera's Angular course üßê. I havent made barely changes compared to the project that Fernando Herrera made on the course, but just because I want to learn and adquire the Express.js knowledge ü§ì. I learnt with this project about:

:vertical_traffic_light: Hot to use CORS in an Express.js app. <br>
:yellow_heart: How to use Dotenv in an Express.js app. <br>
:envelope_with_arrow: How to create endpoints and reply to frontend requests with JSON Web Tokens. <br>
:key: How to encrypt passwords with Bcript. <br>
:leaves: How to use Mongoose and a no-SQL DB like Mongo DB. <br>
:orange_heart: How to use better Postman to simulate the frontend requests. <br>
:sunglasses: You can check the frontend part of this app here: https://github.com/SergioGordillo/LoginAppAngular. <br>
